Using spatial datasets found here: https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/ complete the following
tasks in R or Python. This dataset using Landsat to categorize land cover into specific crop
categories. However, the categorization is unreliable in several areas.
1. Select an area of interest (e.g. Idaho state boundary), preferably using another spatial/polygon
data source, like US Census Tiger files.
2. Create a reasonable algorithm that identifies field boundaries and cleans up obvious errors in the
remote-sensed data raster data (see below).
￼
This figure is an example of remote sensed and classified field data. Notice that fields and crop
circles have many pixels that are incorrectly classified, since fields are generally planted with a
single crop (though crop circles may be divided). Pixels represent 30x30m grids.
3. Create a cleaned (easily readable) spatial dataset with the appropriate key for all pixels at the
same projection and coordinate system.

How to solve these types of problem?
